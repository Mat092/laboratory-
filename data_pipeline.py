DATA:
    
    text data : just text, data stored as text file that needs to be read
        by a computer. the advamtages are that a human can undrstand them
        but are expensive in term of space (redundancy).
        
        Comma Separated Value = CSV 
            values are separated in columns by a comma 
        
        we can also have TSV = Tab Sep Val
        
        JSON = commnly used on the web, ususally a dictionary of
            dictionary at high degree
            
            csv = table
            JSON = no idea of what it is 
            JSON lines = as simple as csv but being able to parse
            
            INI file : simple configuration files
            
            YAML : rich and complicated, just used for configuration file
    
    XMl = really common, but never seen raw. Evolution of old html,
        it work on tags inside tags and so on. Great for storing 
        hyerarchical data, but is very very verbose, it takes a lot of
        space, not easy to read.
    
    a lot of text format are actually XML under the hood.
    
        
        
    binary data : lower level
   
    csv and json are the easier to read.

"""
Binary Formats.

the format of a binary file is not readeble by a human of course.
For each application of a program theres a huge number of type. You want 
them to be as fast to read as possible.

Lossless Images = contains a point for each pixel (R,G,B,int) 
    there'r no identy of object in a png format, every
